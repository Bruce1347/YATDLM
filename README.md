# YATDLM - Yet Another ToDo Lists Manager

## What is this project

This project is a todo lists manager.

## Why

* Fun
* In order to self host my own todo list manager
* Write python and build a django application on my free time

## Development

This project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management.

If you'd like to contribute or just launch YATDLM in your own local setup do the following:

* Install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)
* At the root of the cloned repository, run `poetry install`
* After the first install, just run `poetry shell` to spawn a shell inside the virtualenv created by Poetry
